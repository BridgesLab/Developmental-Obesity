Figure Key - For each figure, on the table I'll say what script and which output file. 
In illustrator, don't embed - just link it- it'll upload the most updated version on the 
figure. Anything pulled from DB->csv->reload to do the plots. When we put it in the repository, get rid of update.data. Put effect sizes and p-values in the text (method result, figure legend/figure)- at the end do the intro and discussion.  


| Figure | Script | File |

|1 A and B | adobe | grant file and eTRF folder from udrive|
