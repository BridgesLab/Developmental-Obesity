To make notes to myself as I'm writing. /check with Dave about stats
Go through offspring protocol, fix fonts and dates, add in in vivo and in vitro GSIS
fixed the color scheme to be grayscale
remember to make things larger in font 
Font used in regular times (12-16 point font)
fix m/f and facet to be consistent btw graphs
